    <h2>Why Teach?</h2>
    <p>
      There are many reasons to choose a career in teaching.  Here are some reasons our cadets are exploring this most noble of professions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Teaching is one of the most rewarding professions in the world.</li>
        <li>Teaching is never boring! Each day, your students bring fresh new energy to the classroom.</li>
        <li>Teachers get a glimpse of our world in the near future- and influence what it will look like!</li>
        <li>Teachers make a difference in the lives of the students we touch.</li>
        <li>Vacation time is great! Teachers average two to three months of vacation time annually.</li>
        <li>Teaching is a universal profession.  It is a skill that can take you around the globe. </li>
    </ol>

          <h2>Why Join Teacher Cadets?</h2>
          <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('join').style.fontSize='40px'">Enlarge words</button> 
          <p id=join>The Teacher Cadet Programme offers Bahamian high school students a wonderful opportunity to explore the teaching profession.  Cadets meet with other cadets at their schools,
              and they get to meet virtually with many other future teachers from around The Bahamas.  During cadet meetings, cadets have an opportunity to learn new skills, expand their 
              understanding of teaching, learning, the Education Act and the Bahamian classroom.  They play games and learn how to make games of their own.  They participate in spirited 
              debates about current educational issues.  They design posters, flyers, and help to create physical and digital educational resources.  They explore tertiary learning 
              opportunities, getting a sneak peak at what college campuses are like and they receive guidance on college choice and what scholarship opportunities they could take advantage
              of.  They experience teaching during ten weeks of tutoring a child in primary or junior high school.  At the end of the programme, students are able to make an informed 
              decision about whether or not a career in education is the best choice for them.
