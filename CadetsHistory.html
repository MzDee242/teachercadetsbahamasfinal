    <h2>Historical Overview of The Future Teachers of The Bahamas Programme:</h2>
    <p>The year is 1995.  The Ministry of Education has recognized a need to recruit bright young Bahamians to the classrooms of 
        our public schools.  
        A deliberate effort was made to develop a program that would mentor potential teachers while still in high school.  In February, 1995, 
        the Future Teachers of The Bahamas was established.
    <br>The pilot program consisted of a small number of high school students who were selected based on their interest in Teaching.  
    The Coordinator for the pilot program was Mrs. Edith Rolle.  </p>

        <p>The original cohort went on to study in the school of education at the College of The Bahamas and many eventually did fulfill their dream of becoming Bahamian educators.  Meanwhile, the program thrived.  The first few years were ones of growth and change for the Future Teachers of The Bahamas program, or the Teacher Cadet program, as it began to be called.  Cadets explored various aspects of teaching, meeting each week at their schools to explore important issues and to participate in valuable experiences that would mold the teachers that they would become.  </p>
      <p>In 1998, a Future Teachers conference was established in New Providence.  The conference allowed cadets to meet and dedicate an entire day to exploring their future career.  Seeing the benefit of such a conference, schools in Freeport, Grand Bahama hosted conferences of their own.  Today, there is one national conference that family island and New Providence cohorts alike look forward to.</p>

    <p>In 2004, Mrs. Sharon Creary joined the Tertiary Quality Assurance Unit and was charged with assisting Mrs. Edith Rolle in the coordination of the Future Teachers of The Bahamas program.  She became the coordinator of the program in 2012.  She was successful in implementing a number of competitions and activities for the program. </p>

    <p>Today, the Future Teachers of The Bahamas program has expanded well beyond the original pilot.  It has grown from  one island to over 13 islands across the archipelago.  Meetings have grown from school based, to island based and now, to a national virtual platform where all cadets across the country can meet, collaborate and grow together.  The Teacher Cadet Programme has produced more than two hundred and fifty Bahamian teachers who are trained, passionate and committed to improving the standard of education in the country.  Many former cadets are now advisors and Mrs. Demetria Dawkins Rolle, one of the original pilot cadets is now the coordinator.  And still we grow, shaping minds, inspiring passions, imparting knowledge, building a nation by nurturing tomorrowâ€™s teachers today!</p>
